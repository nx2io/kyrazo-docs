Welcome to Kyrazo! This guide will help you get your first event dispatched from your system to a webhook target.

## 1. Get your API Key

To authenticate your requests, you'll need an API Key.

1.  Log in to the [Kyrazo Dashboard](https://kyrazo.com/dashboard).
2.  Navigate to the **Secrets Page** in the sidebar.
3.  Click **Generate New Key**.
4.  Give it a name and select the necessary **Scopes** (e.g., `Dispatch Event`).
5.  Copy and securely store your **API Key**. You won't be able to see it again!

<Note>
  Keep your API Key secure. If it's ever compromised, you can rotate it from the settings page.
</Note>

## 2. Create a Target

A Target is where Kyrazo will deliver your events.

1.  In the dashboard, go to the **Targets** section.
2.  Click **Create Target**.
3.  Enter a name (e.g., "My API") and a destination URL. If you don't have one yet, you can use a tool like [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to test.
4.  Save the target and note down its **Target ID**.

## 3. Dispatch your first event

Now you're ready to send data. Use the following `curl` command (replace the placeholders with your actual values):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.kyrazo.com/v1/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/publish" \
     -H "x-api-key: {YOUR_API_KEY}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "eventType": "user.signup",
       "data": {
         "userId": "123",
         "email": "user@example.com"
       },
       "targets": [
         { "targetId": "{YOUR_TARGET_ID}" }
       ]
     }'
```

## 4. Verify Delivery

Once you send the request, you can verify the result:

1.  Check your destination URL (or Webhook.site) to see the incoming payload.
2.  In the Kyrazo Dashboard, navigate to the **Dispatch/Ingest Logs** for your project.
3.  You should see your event listed with a status of `Queued` or `Delivered`, along with detailed logs for the delivery attempt.
