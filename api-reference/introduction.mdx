## Overview

The Integration API allows you to programmatically publish events and manage webhook targets within your projects. It is designed for high-performance and reliable event delivery.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using the **x-api-key** header. You can manage your API keys within the [Kyrazo Dashboard](https://kyrazo.com/dashboard) under the **Secrets Page**.

```bash
x-api-key: <your_api_key>
```

### Idempotency

To prevent duplicate processing of the same request (e.g., due to network retries), you can provide an optional `X-Idempotency-Key` header. Kyrazo ensures that requests with the same key are processed only once.

```bash
X-Idempotency-Key: <unique_key>
```

## Base URL

The production base URL for the Kyrazo Integration API is:

```http
https://api.kyrazo.com
```

<Note>
  Ensure you are using the correct Project ID from your dashboard when constructing the publish URL: `https://api.kyrazo.com/v1/events/{projectId}/publish`
</Note>
