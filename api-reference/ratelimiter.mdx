Kyrazo applies rate limits to ensure the stability and reliability of the platform for all users. Limits are applied per workspace and depend on your subscription plan.

## Rate Limit Tiers

The specific limits for your workspace depend on your plan. For the **Free** tier, the following limits apply:

| Limit Type | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Requests Per Second (RPS)** | 25 requests/sec |
| **Monthly Event Quota** | 100,000 events/month |
| **Fallback (Unauthenticated)** | 5 requests/sec per IP |

<Note>
  If you require higher limits, please contact us or upgrade your plan via the dashboard.
</Note>

## Resource Specific Limits

### Events API

The Events API endpoints (`/publish` and `/publish/batch`) use your workspace's RPS limit. 

- **Single Event**: Each request counts as 1 against your RPS.
- **Batch Events**: A batch request counts as 1 request against your RPS, regardless of the number of events in the batch. However, the individual events within the batch count toward your monthly event quota.

### Targets API

Management of webhook targets is also subject to the same RPS limits. This includes:
- Listing and retrieving targets (Read)
- Creating, updating, and deleting targets (Write)

## Exceeding Limits

If you exceed your rate limit, the API will respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code. The response body will include details on when you can retry:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "Too many requests. Please upgrade your plan or slow down.",
    "retryAfter": 1
  }
}
```

### Response Headers

When a rate limit is exceeded, the following header is included:

- `Retry-After`: The number of seconds to wait before your next request will be accepted.
