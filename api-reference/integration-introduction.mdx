## Overview

The Integration API allows you to programmatically publish events and manage webhook targets within your projects. It is designed for high-performance and reliable event delivery.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using the **x-api-key** header. You can generate API keys within the Hookify Dashboard under your Project Settings.

```bash
x-api-key: <your_api_key>
```

### Idempotency

To prevent duplicate processing of the same request (e.g., due to network retries), you can provide an optional `Idempotency-Key` header. Hookify ensures that requests with the same key are processed only once.

```bash
Idempotency-Key: <unique_key>
```

## Base URL

The default base URL for the Integration API is:

```http
http://localhost:3004
```

<Note>
  In production, please use the official Kyrazo API URL provided in your
  dashboard.
