Kyrazo is a professional event orchestration platform designed to help teams reliably receive, process, and route events between systems. It acts as a central nervous system for your integrations, ensuring that every event reaches its destination—no matter what.

## Why Kyrazo?

Building a reliable webhook infrastructure is deceptively complex. As your system grows, you quickly encounter challenges that go far beyond a simple HTTP POST request.

### The Problem: Webhooks are Hard

Implementing webhooks manually often leads to several recurring pain points:

    Managing exponential backoff, jitter, and persistent delivery failures is a heavy engineering lift.

    Generating and verifying webhook signatures correctly is critical but error-prone.

    When a delivery fails in a custom implementation, it often disappears into a black hole without logs.
