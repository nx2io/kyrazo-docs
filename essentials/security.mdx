Kyrazo provides a granular security model to protect your data and ensure that only authorized systems can interact with your event infrastructure.

## API Keys

Your interaction with the Kyrazo Integration API is authenticated via **API Keys**. You can manage these in the **Secrets Page** of the Kyrazo Dashboard.

### Creating a Key

When you generate a new key, you can configure the following:

-   **Name**: A descriptive label (e.g., "GitHub Actions CI", "Production Backend").
-   **Scopes**: Fine-grained permissions that define what the key can do.
-   **Expiration**: (Optional) A date when the key will automatically become invalid.

### Scopes (Permissions)

Kyrazo uses scopes to enforce the principle of least privilege. We recommend creating separate keys with limited scopes for different services.

| Group | Scopes | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dispatch** | `dispatch:event`, `dispatch:event:batch` | Ability to publish single or batch events. |
| **Targets** | `dispatch:target:*` | CRUD operations for outbound targets and key rotation. |
| **Sources** | `ingest:source:*` | CRUD operations for inbound sources. |
| **Endpoints** | `ingest:endpoint:*` | CRUD operations for internal endpoints. |

## Idempotency

To prevent accidental duplicate events during network retries, Kyrazo supports the `X-Idempotency-Key` header.

When you include this header in a `POST` request, Kyrazo will:
1.  Check if a request with that key was already processed in the last 24 hours.
2.  If it's new, process the request and store the result.
3.  If it's a duplicate, return the **original response** immediately without re-processing the event.

<Tip>
  We recommend using a UUID v4 or a combination of the event type and your internal entity ID as the idempotency key.
</Tip>

## Signature Verification

When Kyrazo dispatches events to your **Targets** or **Endpoints**, it signs the payload using HMAC-SHA256. 

### Rotating Secrets

If a secret is compromised, you can rotate it via the dashboard or API:
1.  Add a new secret to the target.
2.  Both secrets will be valid for a transition period (if supported by your implementation).
3.  Once your system is updated to use the new secret, remove the old one.

For detailed verification steps, see the [Target Management](/essentials/target-management#security-hmac-signatures) guide.
