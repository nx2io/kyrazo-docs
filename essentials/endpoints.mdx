description: "Configure internal destinations for your ingested events"
---

An **Endpoint** is an internal destination within your infrastructure where Kyrazo delivers ingested events.

## Endpoint Configuration

Endpoints are managed at the Project level. When an event is received by a **Source**, Kyrazo looks up the linked **Endpoints** and dispatches the data to them.

### Key Attributes

- **URL**: The HTTP(S) destination where your service is listening.
- **Method**: The HTTP method to use for delivery (typically `POST`).
- **Status**: Endpoints can be toggled between `Active` and `Inactive`. Events will not be delivered to inactive endpoints.

## Security & Reliability

### Signing Secrets
Kyrazo can sign outgoing requests to your endpoints using HMAC. This allows your internal service to verify that the request truly came from Kyrazo.

### Custom Headers
You can configure static custom headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) that Kyrazo will include in every request sent to the endpoint.

### Retry Policy
If your endpoint is temporarily unavailable, Kyrazo's background workers will automatically retry the delivery based on the configured retry count.

## Differences from Targets

While **Targets** (used in Dispatch) are often managed dynamically for end-user integrations, **Endpoints** (used in Ingest) are typically static destinations within your own infrastructure or VPC that you configure once.
