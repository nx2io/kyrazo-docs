To effectively use Kyrazo, it's important to understand the three fundamental concepts that power the platform: **Dispatch**, **Events**, and **Targets**.

## 1. Dispatch

The **Dispatch** layer is the orchestration heart of Kyrazo. It responsible for receiving incoming events and ensuring they are reliably delivered to the correct destinations.

- **High-Performance Architecture**: Kyrazo uses a high-concurrency orchestration engine for message queuing. This allows for extremely high throughput while maintaining strong delivery guarantees.
- **Reliability**: Once an event is accepted by the Dispatch API, Kyrazo guarantees at-least-once delivery.
- **Automatic Retries**: If a delivery fails, the Dispatcher automatically retries based on configurable policies (e.g., exponential backoff).
- **Concurrency Control**: Kyrazo manages the delivery rate to prevent overwhelming your targets.

## 2. Events

An **Event** is the core unit of data in Kyrazo. It represents something that happened in your system that you want to share with external integration targets.

- **Event Type**: A descriptive string (e.g., `user.created`, `order.completed`) that helps targets identify what happened.
- **Payload**: The actual data associated with the event. Kyrazo supports standard JSON payloads.
  - **`data`**: The current state of the object.
  - **`previous`**: (Optional) The state of the object before the event occurred, useful for tracking changes.
- **Metadata**: Every event includes metadata for tracking and control, such as a unique `eventId`, a `timestamp`, and an `idempotencyKey` to prevent duplicate processing.

## 3. Targets

A **Target** is a destination where Kyrazo delivers your events. In most cases, this is a webhook URL provided by your users or secondary systems.

- **Project-Based**: Targets are grouped within **Projects**, allowing you to isolate integrations for different environments or product lines.
- **Delivery Protocol**: Standard HTTP(S) requests (POST, PUT, PATCH, etc.).
- **Security**: kyrazo provides professional-grade security for targets:
  - **Signing Secrets**: Every target can have a unique secret used to generate HMAC signatures, allowing the receiver to verify the payload's integrity.
  - **Custom Headers**: You can configure static headers (e.g., `Authorization`) for each target.
- **Management**: Targets can be enabled or disabled at any time via the API or the Kyrazo Management Dashboard.

### How they work together

1. Your system **publishes** an **Event** to Kyrazo.
2. The **Dispatch** layer validates the event and queues it for high-performance delivery.
3. Kyrazo identifies all active **Targets** associated with the project.
4. The Dispatcher delivers the event to each **Target**, handling retries and security signatures automatically.
