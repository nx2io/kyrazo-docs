A **Target** is an external HTTP destination (webhook) that Kyrazo delivers your events to.

## Configuration

Targets are highly configurable to match the requirements of any destination service:

- **URL & Method**: The destination endpoint and the preferred HTTP method (default is `POST`).
- **Custom Headers**: Add static headers like `Authorization` or `X-Client-ID` to every request.
- **Retry Policy**: Configure how many times Kyrazo should retry if the target is unavailable (default is 3).
- **Timeout**: Control how long Kyrazo waits for a response before timing out a delivery attempt.

## Security (HMAC Signatures)

Kyrazo secures event delivery using HMAC-SHA256 signatures. This allows the receiving target to verify that the event truly came from your system via Kyrazo and hasn't been tampered with.

### Verification Headers

Every request delivered to a target includes the following security headers:

| Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `X-Webhook-Signature` | The HMAC-SHA256 signature (prefixed with `v1=`). |
| `X-Webhook-Timestamp` | The Unix timestamp when the request was generated. |
| `X-Webhook-Nonce` | A unique string for each request to prevent replay attacks. |
| `X-Webhook-Version` | The signature version (e.g., `v1`). |

### How to Verify

To verify the signature:
1.  Concatenate the version, timestamp, nonce, and raw request body using a dot (`.`) as a separator:
    `v1.timestamp.nonce.body`
2.  Hash this string using HMAC-SHA256 with your **Target Secret** as the key.
3.  Compare the resulting hex-encoded hash with the value provided in the `X-Webhook-Signature` header.

## Secret Rotation

To maintain high security, Kyrazo supports multiple secrets per target. You can add a new secret as "active" and keep the old one as "inactive" during a transition period. This allows the receiver to rotate keys without any downtime or missed events.

<Tip>
  You can find and manage your Target Secrets in the **Security** tab of any target in the Kyrazo Dashboard.
