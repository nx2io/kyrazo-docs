description: "Understand how Kyrazo receives and routes external webhooks"
---

While **Dispatch** handles outbound events from your system, **Ingest** is designed to handle the opposite: receiving events from external 3rd-party services (like Stripe, PayPal, or custom webhooks) and routing them to your internal infrastructure.

## What is Ingest?

Ingest acts as a secure, highly-available gateway for incoming webhooks. Instead of exposing your internal services directly to the public internet, you point your 3rd-party webhooks to Kyrazo.

## Why use Kyrazo for Ingest?

1.  **Uniform Security**: Standardize how you verify webhooks from multiple different providers in one place.
2.  **Reliability**: Kyrazo buffers incoming bursts of traffic and ensures events are delivered to your internal endpoints, even if they are temporarily down.
3.  **Auditability**: Maintain a complete history of every 3rd-party event received, including raw payloads and delivery attempts.
4.  **Decoupling**: Shield your internal services from the direct complexity of 3rd-party webhook protocols.

## High-Level Flow

1.  **3rd-Party Service** (e.g., Stripe) sends a webhook to your unique Kyrazo **Ingress URL**.
2.  Kyrazo **ingests** the event, validates authentication, and acknowledges receipt.
3.  The event is placed in a **Distributed Queue** for background processing.
4.  Kyrazo identifies the associated **Source** configuration and identifies which **Endpoints** should receive the data.
5.  Kyrazo **dispatches** the processed event to your internal **Endpoints**.
